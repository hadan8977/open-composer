description: Adapt Beautiful UI interaction patterns for conversational and task-focused React interfaces. Use for compact action menus, truthful async feedback, attachment composers, and transfer disclosures. Includes plain-CSS React primitives; not a complete application framework or an AI backend.

# Beautiful UI

Follow the [local skill map](../impeccable/reference/skill-map.md). This specialist implements the selected direction; open product-wide design questions return to impeccable. A scoped component or material request does not restart the full design process.

Use the visual economy of [Beautiful UI](https://www.beautifului.dev/) without importing its simulated workflows. Preserve the user's product and interaction contracts. A visual demo is evidence of appearance, not evidence of production behavior.

## Choose the useful part

Read [the component map](references/component-map.md) before choosing a pattern. Check the target application's state ownership and styling system. Keep existing icons, typography, spacing, and accessibility mechanisms where they already work.

The bundled source library in `assets/react/` has two independent React + TypeScript primitives and one plain CSS stylesheet:

- `GlideActions`: one moving pointer/keyboard highlight behind native action buttons. It supplies no menu role, keyboard-navigation model, or business actions. Use normal Tab navigation unless the application already implements a full menu.
- `FeedbackButton`: a controlled icon transition for `idle`, `pending`, and `success`. The caller supplies icons, performs the operation, reports errors, announces success, and resets success state. Keep the accessible label stable; the tooltip may say “Copied”.

Copy only the selected primitive and needed CSS into the project's existing component directory. Preserve `LICENSE` when adapting GlideActions. These are source templates, not an npm package or shadcn registry; no install command is required. In GropBox, `src/components/ui/` is the maintained implementation and these assets are a reuse snapshot. Refresh that snapshot only when changing the reusable primitives, not for app-specific styling.

## Fit the host interface

Reuse the interaction, not every layer of the gallery's presentation. For a minimal AI-native brief, prioritize direct actions, stable content, and clear state changes; adding a pill enclosure, glow, or thinking animation does not make a control more useful.

Compare the composer, search, navigation, and action groups together. Shared typography, color tokens, and motion can make them coherent without giving every group the same glass shell. Let selection and the primary available action carry emphasis; disabled controls should remain legible without looking equally active. Removing a decorative wrapper must preserve touch targets and keyboard focus.

Fit geometry before animating it. Align the integrated control with the host's content columns, text baseline, shared heights, padding, and icon weight; do not retain a gallery tile or raised icon backing merely because the source has one. Check short Chinese action labels at the intended narrow width: keep the label intact and reflow the action group. Inspect long content and the control's actual pending/error states in the page before judging its moving highlight.

## Integration rules that affect behavior

- Derive task status, byte counts, and errors from real operations. Do not drive progress or success with a demo timer. A short feedback-reset timer is different from a simulated operation.
- Await clipboard/upload/save success before showing completion. Keep drafts on failure and expose a retry or useful error. Never clear the input merely because an animation started.
- A collapsible task group needs `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and inert hidden content. Keep failure counts visible when collapsed. Distinguish staged attachments from active transfers; retain the application's send/drop policy.
- Put status transitions inside stable geometry. Preserve at least 44px touch targets and a usable visible action on touch devices. Do not move the message text when an icon changes.
- Clean up timers and async listeners. Honor reduced motion. Pointer decoration cannot be the sole focus indicator or an extra focusable element.
- Inspect any additional upstream component before reuse: the gallery contains simulated stage sequences and dependencies unsuitable for some applications. Do not install an entire styling or animation stack to reproduce one interaction.

For glass/shader work, this library handles controls, not rendering. Use the available `liquid-materials` skill if relevant; otherwise keep a static surface. Decorative activity must not masquerade as network progress.

## Verify and stop

Exercise the integrated primitive with keyboard and touch-sized layouts, a real success path, and the applicable failure path. Inspect it in the assembled page, including dark/light and idle/focused states when supported: an attractive isolated component can become heavy when repeated. Check that interaction state remains authoritative and reduced motion works. Stop after the requested component works in context; do not import the rest of the gallery.
